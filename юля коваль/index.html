        <h2>Where do cats come from?</h2>
        <p>
          People began to domesticate cats in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000
          years ago.Modern-day cats descended from a subspecies of African
          wildcat, Felis silvestris lybica, which today is the most common and
          widespread wildcat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thousands of years ago, these wildcats were likely drawn to human
          settlements and their plentiful mice and food scraps. People realized
          these rodent catchers were helpful to have around, and eventually the
          two species began living together.
